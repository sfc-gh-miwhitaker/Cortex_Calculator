## üìã Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

- ‚úÖ **Snowflake account** with Cortex usage (ideally 7-14 days of history)
- ‚úÖ **ACCOUNTADMIN role** OR role with `IMPORTED PRIVILEGES` on `SNOWFLAKE` database
- ‚úÖ **Active warehouse** for running queries
- ‚úÖ **Access to Snowsight** (Snowflake's web interface)

### Quick Access Test

Run this query to verify you have the required permissions:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.METERING_DAILY_HISTORY 
WHERE usage_date >= DATEADD('day', -7, CURRENT_DATE());
```

**Expected:** A number (even if 0) - not an error message

**If error:** Grant privileges first:
```sql
USE ROLE ACCOUNTADMIN;
GRANT IMPORTED PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE SNOWFLAKE TO ROLE <YOUR_ROLE>;
```

---

## üöÄ Step 1: Deploy Monitoring (5 minutes)

This creates 9 read-only views that track all Cortex service usage.

### 1.1 Access Snowflake

1. Navigate to [https://app.snowflake.com](https://app.snowflake.com)
2. Log in with your credentials
3. Click **Worksheets** in the left navigation
4. Create a new worksheet

### 1.2 Run Deployment Script

1. Open `sql/deploy_cortex_monitoring.sql` from this project
2. Copy the entire file contents
3. Paste into your Snowflake worksheet
4. Click **"Run All"** (or press `Ctrl+Enter` to run all statements)

### 1.3 Verify Deployment

Watch for these success messages:

- ‚úÖ Database `SNOWFLAKE_EXAMPLE` created
- ‚úÖ Schema `CORTEX_USAGE` created
- ‚úÖ 9 views created successfully
- ‚úÖ Validation queries showing row counts

**What got created:**
```
SNOWFLAKE_EXAMPLE.CORTEX_USAGE
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ V_CORTEX_ANALYST_DETAIL
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ V_CORTEX_SEARCH_DETAIL
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ V_CORTEX_SEARCH_SERVING_DETAIL
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ V_CORTEX_FUNCTIONS_DETAIL
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ V_CORTEX_FUNCTIONS_QUERY_DETAIL
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ V_DOCUMENT_DETAIL
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ V_CORTEX_DAILY_SUMMARY           ‚Üê Main rollup view
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ V_CORTEX_COST_EXPORT             ‚Üê Pre-formatted for calculator
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ V_METERING_SERVICES              ‚Üê High-level validation
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Note:** Views may show 0 rows if:
- No Cortex usage in last 90 days
- Data latency (wait 3 hours after usage)
- This is normal and won't prevent deployment

---

## üìä Step 2: Deploy Calculator (5 minutes)

Deploy the interactive Streamlit calculator in Snowflake.

### 2.1 Create Streamlit App

In Snowsight:

1. Click **"Projects"** in left navigation

| Field | Value | Notes |
|-------|-------|-------|
| **App name** | `CORTEX_COST_CALCULATOR` | Or your preferred name |
| **App location** | `SNOWFLAKE_EXAMPLE.CORTEX_USAGE` | Must match where views were deployed |
| **Warehouse** | Select your warehouse | SMALL is sufficient |

### 2.3 Add Application Code

1. Open `streamlit/cortex_cost_calculator/streamlit_app.py` from this project
2. Copy the **entire file contents**
3. In Snowflake, paste into the code editor (replacing the default code)

### 2.4 Add Package Dependencies

1. Click the **"Packages"** tab in the Snowflake editor
2. Open `streamlit/cortex_cost_calculator/environment.yml` from this project

1. Click **"Create"** button (bottom right)
2. Wait 30 seconds for the app to initialize
3. The app will automatically launch when ready

**üéâ Success!** You now have a fully functional cost calculator.

## üí∞ Step 3: Analyze Your Costs (5 minutes)

Now let's use the calculator to understand your Cortex spending.

### 3.1 Configure Data Source

In the calculator sidebar:

**For same-account deployment (customers):**
- **Data Source:** Select **"Query Views (Same Account)"**
- **Lookback Period:** 30 days (adjust as needed)
- **Credit Cost:** Update to your actual credit price (default: $3.00)

**For SE workflow (analyzing customer data):**
- **Data Source:** Select **"Upload Customer CSV"**
- Upload the CSV file extracted from customer account
- Credit cost will be configured per analysis

### 3.2 Review Historical Analysis

Click the **"üìà Historical Analysis"** tab:

**You'll see:**
- **Summary metrics:** Total credits, total cost, avg daily usage
- **Service breakdown:** Which services consume the most credits
- **Usage trends:** Daily credit consumption over time
- **Service distribution:** Pie chart showing cost allocation

**Use this to:**
- Validate data quality
- Understand current spending patterns
- Identify which services drive costs
- Detect usage anomalies

### 3.3 Generate Cost Projections

Click the **"üîÆ Cost Projections"** tab:

**Configure projections:**
1. **Projection Period:** Choose 3, 6, 12, or 24 months
2. **Monthly Growth Rate:** Use slider (0-100%)
3. **Pre-defined scenarios:**
   - **Conservative (10%):** Steady adoption, existing use cases
   - **Moderate (25%):** Active expansion, new features
   - **Aggressive (50%):** Rapid rollout, multiple teams
   - **Rapid (100%):** Explosive growth, company-wide adoption

**You'll see:**
- **Month 1 vs Month 12 costs**
- **Total year cost** with variance range
- **Interactive chart** with confidence bands
- **Monthly breakdown table**

### 3.4 Model User Personas (Multi-User Calculator)

Scroll down to the **"üí∞ Cost per User Calculator"** section:

**Define your user types:**
1. **Add/Edit Personas:**
   - Default: Power User (5 @ 2.0x), Regular User (15 @ 1.0x), Casual User (10 @ 0.3x)
   - Click ‚ûï **Add Persona** to add more
   - Click üóëÔ∏è to remove personas
   - Adjust user counts and intensity multipliers

2. **Set Baseline Usage:**
   - Operations per user per month for each service
   - Pre-filled with historical averages
   - All personas multiply from this baseline

**You'll see:**
- **Total users** across all personas
- **Total monthly cost** breakdown
- **Per-persona costs** with detailed tables
- **Budget capacity** with scaling options

**Use this for:**
- Modeling 10-30 test users with different usage patterns
- Department cost allocation
- Optimizing user mix for budget constraints

### 3.5 Compare Scenarios

Click the **"üìä Scenario Comparison"** tab:

- **Side-by-side** comparison of all growth scenarios
- **Custom scenario builder** with specific parameters
- **Export comparison table** for stakeholder presentations

### 3.6 Export Estimates

Click the **"üìã Summary Report"** tab:

1. Review **credit breakdown by service**
2. Click **"Download Credit Estimate (CSV)"**
3. Open in Excel for proposals or budget documents

**The CSV includes:**
- Service-by-service breakdown
- Daily and monthly projections
- Cost estimates at current credit price
- Notes on methodology

---

## üîß Troubleshooting

### No Data Showing

**If views return 0 rows:**

1. **Check if Cortex has been used:**
   ```sql
   SELECT * 
   FROM SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.METERING_DAILY_HISTORY 
   WHERE service_type = 'AI_SERVICES' 
   ORDER BY usage_date DESC 
   LIMIT 10;
   ```

2. **Wait for data latency:** ACCOUNT_USAGE has 45 min - 3 hour delay

3. **Extend lookback period:** Edit the deployment script to use 180 days instead of 90

### Permission Errors

**Error: "Object does not exist"**

Solution:
```sql
USE ROLE ACCOUNTADMIN;
GRANT IMPORTED PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE SNOWFLAKE TO ROLE <YOUR_ROLE>;
```

### Calculator Won't Load

**Troubleshooting steps:**

1. **Verify warehouse is running**
   - Check warehouse status in Snowsight
   - Resume warehouse if suspended

2. **Check app location matches deployment**
   - App location: `SNOWFLAKE_EXAMPLE.CORTEX_USAGE`
   - Views location: Same path

3. **Refresh browser**
   - Clear cache and reload
   - Try incognito/private window

## üßπ Cleanup (When Finished)

To remove all monitoring objects:

```sql
-- Run cleanup script
@sql/cleanup_cortex_monitoring.sql
```

**Choose one option:**
1. **Drop views only** - Keeps schema for future use
2. **Drop schema** - Removes all monitoring objects
3. **Drop database** - Complete removal

All cleanup is safe and reversible by re-running the deployment script.
